        <h1>NIGHT THEME</h1>
        <p>As the sun sets, the world sinks into a quiet, mysterious calm. The sky turns deep and dark, sprinkled with stars that glow like tiny dreams. The moon takes its throne, casting silver light on sleeping streets and whispering trees. The night feels peaceful yet powerful — a time for reflection, secrets, and silent beauty beneath the cosmic veil..</p>

        <p  style="background-color: chartreuse; color: black;">Green is the color of renewal — a living heartbeat of nature that soothes the soul. It’s the whisper of leaves dancing in the wind, the promise of rain on growing fields, and the calm after every storm. Surrounded by green, the world feels alive and breathing, reminding us that growth is gentle yet powerful. It’s the shade of balance, healing, and hope — where life begins again and again.</p>
